# ElevenLabs Voice Agent - Production Ready System

## Background and Motivation

**CURRENT STATE**: ‚úÖ Production-ready ElevenLabs voice agent system with comprehensive logging and dashboard

**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**:
- **ElevenLabs**: Primary Conversational AI platform with native Twilio integration
- **Twilio**: Telephony infrastructure integrated through ElevenLabs platform
- **Supabase**: Database for call logging, transcriptions, and conversation metadata
- **Node.js**: Backend server with Express.js for API management
- **Gemini**: For post-call transcript analysis

**COMPLETED FEATURES**:
- ‚úÖ ElevenLabs integration with comprehensive call logging
- ‚úÖ Gemini transcript analysis (meeting booked, interest, upset detection)
- ‚úÖ Advanced dashboard with charts, filtering, and pagination
- ‚úÖ Call detail views with transcript support
- ‚úÖ Analytics dashboard with 6 chart types
- ‚úÖ Sequence preparation infrastructure

**NEXT OBJECTIVE**: üéØ Phase 18 - ElevenLabs Sync Data Mapping Fixes
Fix critical data synchronization issues between ElevenLabs API and Supabase database including incorrect status mapping, date display problems, and potential duplicate call entries. Ensure call history matches ElevenLabs UI exactly.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: ElevenLabs Integration and Dashboard
- ‚úÖ ElevenLabs API integration and call management
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive call logging for all calls (including external)
- ‚úÖ Gemini transcript analysis with boolean storage
- ‚úÖ Advanced dashboard with filtering, pagination, and analytics
- ‚úÖ Call detail views with transcript enhancement

### üéØ CURRENT CHALLENGE: ElevenLabs Sync Data Mapping Issues

**Objective**: Fix critical data synchronization problems between ElevenLabs API and Supabase database to ensure accurate call history display matching ElevenLabs UI.

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. **Incorrect Status Mapping**: Current system maps ElevenLabs statuses incorrectly and processes incomplete calls
2. **Date Display Mismatch**: Multiple calls showing on same date in UI vs ElevenLabs, inconsistent date extraction
3. **Missing Evaluation Results**: Status field not storing proper call outcomes ("answered", "no answer", "failed")
4. **Incomplete Call Filtering**: Processing in-progress/initiated calls that should be skipped

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Contacts, Sequences, and Uploads

**Previous Objective**: Update schema for contacts and phone numbers, implement views for calls per person/number, sequence management, and contact upload feature.

**Key Requirements**:
1. **Database Schema Update**: Add contacts and phone_numbers tables, update calls table with links and new fields like call_result, answered.
2. **Contacts Management**: Handle people with multiple phones, names, email, company, position.
3. **Call Views**: Lists of calls per contact and per phone number.
4. **Sequences**: Put numbers into sequences for retries if unanswered, track attempts, next call time.
5. **Uploads**: Upload CSV lists of contacts, parse and insert into DB, add to sequences.
6. **Future Notes**: Ability to add notes after calls (e.g., callback time).
7. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all new views are mobile-friendly.
8. **Performance**: Efficient querying for large datasets, migration without data loss.

**Challenges**:
- Safe schema migration on existing data, handling cases where numbers don't have associated contacts initially.
- Handling unknown contacts/numbers gracefully.
- Implementing sequence logic without overcomplicating, including batch calling with concurrency limits.
- Parsing and validating uploaded CSV data.
- Ensuring data consistency (e.g., propagating 'do_not_call' status).

## High-level Task Breakdown

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Phases 1-17 - Full System Implementation

**Phases 1-11**: ‚úÖ ElevenLabs integration, call logging, Gemini analysis, dashboard with analytics
**Phase 12**: ‚úÖ Database schema update - contacts and phone_numbers tables

### üéØ Phase 18: ElevenLabs Sync Data Mapping Fixes

- [x] **Task 18.1**: Fix Status Mapping Logic and Call Filtering ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Critical sync logic errors
  - **Requirements**:
    - Skip calls with status `in-progress`, `initiated`, `processing` (don't add to database)
    - Map `done` + duration > 5s ‚Üí "answered"
    - Map `done` + duration ‚â§ 5s ‚Üí "no answer"  
    - Map `failed` ‚Üí "failed"
    - **BONUS**: Override "failed" calls with duration > 5s ‚Üí "answered"
  - **Success Criteria**: Only completed calls stored in database with correct status values
  - **Implementation**: Updated mapElevenLabsStatus() function with new logic and added call filtering in processConversation()
  - **Final Status**: ‚úÖ 16 answered, 2 failed, 1 no_answer calls correctly classified

- [x] **Task 18.2**: Fix Date Extraction and Display Consistency ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Date mismatch causing confusion
  - **Requirements**:
    - Extract actual call start time from ElevenLabs API consistently
    - Ensure `start_time` contains actual call attempt time, not sync time
    - Fix UI to display dates matching ElevenLabs dashboard exactly
  - **Success Criteria**: UI dates match ElevenLabs UI dates for same calls
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Updated ElevenLabs service to prioritize `metadata.start_time_unix_secs` over `start_time` field
    - Fixed call sync service to not fallback to `created_at` for start_time
    - Updated UI display logic to show start_time when available, fallback to created_at only if start_time is null
  - **Final Status**: ‚úÖ Date extraction now prioritizes actual call start time from ElevenLabs metadata

- [ ] **Task 18.3**: Investigate and Resolve Duplicate Call Display
  - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Multiple calls showing for single ElevenLabs call
  - **Requirements**:
    - Investigate why multiple calls appear on 05/08 in UI vs single call in ElevenLabs
    - Verify UNIQUE constraint on `elevenlabs_conversation_id` is working
    - Check if duplicates are actual database records or display logic issue
  - **Success Criteria**: Call count matches between ElevenLabs and local UI exactly

### üéØ IN PROGRESS: Phase 18 - ElevenLabs Sync Data Mapping Fixes

**Objective**: Fix critical data synchronization issues between ElevenLabs API and Supabase database to ensure call history matches ElevenLabs UI exactly.

**Current Tasks**:
- [x] **Task 18.1**: Fix Status Mapping Logic and Call Filtering (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - Fixed mapElevenLabsStatus() function to implement new logic
  - Added call filtering to skip incomplete calls (in-progress, initiated, processing)
  - Implemented duration-based mapping: >5s = "answered", ‚â§5s = "no answer"
  - Added override logic for "failed" calls with duration > 5s ‚Üí "answered"
  - Success Criteria: Only completed calls stored with correct status values
  - **Final Result**: 16 answered, 2 failed, 1 no_answer calls correctly classified

- [x] **Task 18.2**: Fix Date Extraction and Display Consistency (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - Standardize start_time extraction from ElevenLabs API
  - Ensure UI displays actual call attempt time, not sync time
  - Success Criteria: UI dates match ElevenLabs UI dates exactly
  - **Implementation**: Updated ElevenLabs service to prioritize metadata.start_time_unix_secs, fixed sync service to not fallback to created_at, updated UI display logic

- [ ] **Task 18.3**: Investigate and Resolve Duplicate Call Display (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
  - Investigate multiple 05/08 calls in UI vs single ElevenLabs call
  - Verify database uniqueness constraints working properly
  - Success Criteria: Call count matches between systems

**CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**:
- ‚ùå **Status Mapping Logic**: Current mapElevenLabsStatus() processes incomplete calls and uses wrong logic
- ‚ùå **Date Extraction**: Multiple date sources causing UI/ElevenLabs date mismatch 
- ‚ùå **Call Filtering**: Processing in-progress/initiated calls that should be skipped
- ‚ùå **Duplicate Display**: Multiple calls showing on same date in UI vs single call in ElevenLabs

**ROOT CAUSES ANALYZED**:
- **Status Logic**: Maps 'done' to 'completed' instead of duration-based "answered"/"no answer"
- **Date Sources**: Complex fallback logic using sync time instead of actual call time
- **Incomplete Filtering**: No logic to skip calls that aren't ready for database storage
- **Display Logic**: UI shows start_time OR created_at, causing date inconsistencies
