Background and Motivation
We need to prevent duplicate `sequence_entries` for the same `(sequence_id, phone_number_id)`, handle concurrency, and provide clearer API feedback for bulk adds. A DB unique constraint plus idempotent service methods will ensure correctness and better UX.

Key Challenges and Analysis
- Ensure no duplicates: enforce at DB and service layers.
- Concurrency: race-safe via unique constraint (Postgres 23505) and pre-check.
- Backward compatibility: bulk API should expose `alreadyInSequence` without breaking existing consumers.

High-level Task Breakdown
1) Add unique constraint on `sequence_entries(sequence_id, phone_number_id)`
   - Success: Constraint exists in DB. Duplicate inserts fail with 23505.
2) Update `addPhoneNumberToSequence` to be idempotent
   - Pre-check for existing row; if found, return `{ status: 'exists' }` (or with entry)
   - Insert with business-hours-aware defaults if not present
   - Catch 23505 and treat as `{ status: 'exists' }`
   - Success: No duplicates; concurrent requests safe.
3) Update `addPhoneNumbersToSequence` to dedupe and count already-present
   - Use `Set` to dedupe incoming IDs
   - Tally `added`, `alreadyInSequence`, collect `errors`
   - Success: Accurate counts returned
4) Verify API returns `alreadyInSequence`
   - `POST /api/sequences/:id/entries` returns the `result` object including `alreadyInSequence`
   - Success: Response includes both counts
5) Sanity test
   - Add the same ID twice and ensure 1 added, 1 alreadyInSequence

Project Status Board
- [x] 1) DB unique constraint created (user confirmed already executed)
- [x] 2) Make `addPhoneNumberToSequence` idempotent with pre-check and 23505 handling
- [x] 3) Deduplicate/count in `addPhoneNumbersToSequence`
- [x] 4) Ensure API response includes `alreadyInSequence` in result
- [ ] 5) Sanity test manual verification (pending user test)
- [x] 6) Fix upload-to-sequence flooding bug: restrict additions to IDs from the current upload only

Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Implemented service changes in `services/supabase-db.js`.
- Bulk endpoint now returns `result` with `added`, `alreadyInSequence`, `errors`.
- No server code changes required for the bulk endpoint beyond consuming result (already done previously).
- Implemented fix: `processCSVUpload`/`processXLSXUpload` now aggregate `phone_number_ids` from `processContactRow`.
- `processCSVUploadToSequence`/`processXLSXUploadToSequence` now pass only those IDs to `addPhoneNumbersToSequence` (removed unfiltered `getPhoneNumbers()` calls).

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Do you want the single-add endpoint `POST /api/sequences/:sequenceId/phone-numbers` to explicitly report when the entry already exists (e.g., message change), or keep current behavior?
 - Please confirm if we should also surface, in the upload UI, a summary like: "X added to sequence, Y were duplicates, Z rows invalid." I can wire this to frontend.

Design Analysis and Recommendations
- N/A for this backend change. If the frontend surfaces counts, suggest messaging like: "X added, Y already in sequence." and surface per-item errors when present.

Lessons
- Supabase PostgREST "no rows" error code is `PGRST116` and should be treated as not found rather than failure.
- Postgres unique violation code `23505` is expected for race conditions; treat as an "exists" outcome, not an error.
 - Avoid broad `getPhoneNumbers()` during scoped operations. Collect and pass explicit IDs from the operation context to prevent unintended bulk actions.

- âœ… Implemented call filtering for non-final calls
- âœ… Removed dependency on ElevenLabs' call_successful field

### âœ… RESOLVED: ElevenLabs Normalization and Outcome Computation

**Objective**: âœ… Implement comprehensive normalization of ElevenLabs API data and outcome computation based on call_result field only.

**Key Requirements Completed**:
1. **Outcome Computation Function**: âœ… Added `computeOutcomeFrom(status_raw, durationSecs)` function
   - âœ… If status_raw in ['initiated','in-progress','processing'] â†’ return null (not final)
   - âœ… If status_raw === 'done': durationSecs > 5 â†’ 'answered', else â†’ 'unanswered'
   - âœ… If status_raw === 'failed': durationSecs > 5 â†’ 'answered' (override), else â†’ 'failed'

2. **ElevenLabs Normalization**: âœ… Updated `getConversationDetailsEnhanced()`:
   - âœ… Extract from documented fields: start_time, duration, status_raw, message_count, transcript
   - âœ… Extract call_summary_title, transcript_summary
   - âœ… Extract to_number from best available documented location
   - âœ… Use proper fallbacks for transcript data

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- âœ… **Outcome Computation**: Implemented pure function based on status_raw and duration only
- âœ… **Data Extraction**: Use documented ElevenLabs API fields consistently
- âœ… **Transcript Handling**: Proper fallback strategies for transcript data
- âœ… **Phone Number Extraction**: Found best documented location for to_number

### âœ… RESOLVED: Sync Flow for Final Calls Only

**Objective**: âœ… Implement sync flow that only persists final calls with call_result, removing dependency on status and answered fields.

**Key Requirements Completed**:
1. **CallSyncService.processConversation()**: âœ… Updated
   - âœ… If status_raw in ['initiated','in-progress','processing'] â†’ skip early; do not persist anything
   - âœ… For status_raw in ['done','failed']: create minimal row or process existing call
   - âœ… Immediately call processDetailedConversation() for all final calls

2. **CallSyncService.processDetailedConversation()**: âœ… Updated
   - âœ… Fetch enhanced details; build consolidatedData with all required fields
   - âœ… Compute call_result = computeOutcomeFrom(status_raw, duration)
   - âœ… Update call with only call_result (not status or answered)
   - âœ… Replace transcriptions: delete by call_id; insert mapped transcript
   - âœ… Run analysis with new criteria: duration >= 10, message_count >= 2, call_result !== 'failed'

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- âœ… **Final Call Filtering**: Only process calls with status 'done' or 'failed'
- âœ… **Minimal Row Creation**: Create minimal rows for new final calls
- âœ… **Outcome Computation**: Use only call_result field, remove answered dependency
- âœ… **Analysis Criteria**: Updated analysis conditions to use new criteria

### âœ… RESOLVED: API and Sorting Definitive Fix

**Objective**: âœ… Implement definitive fix for result ranking by date with proper backend ordering and frontend rendering.

**Key Requirements**:
1. **Backend Sorting**: 
   - Chain orders: `.order('start_time', { ascending: false }).order('created_at', { ascending: false })`
   - Node.js sort fallback: `calls.sort((a,b) => new Date(b.start_time || b.created_at) - new Date(a.start_time || a.created_at))`

2. **Frontend Rendering**:
   - Don't sort; render in order received from backend
   - Ensure pagination matches backend
   - Use callResult parameter instead of status for filtering
   - Only show badges for answered/unanswered/failed
   - Fix duration formatting: minutes and seconds
   - Build haystack search: `[phone_number, enhanced_status, meeting_booked, person_interested, person_very_upset].join(' ')`

**Critical Issues to Address**:
- âœ… **Backend Ordering**: Proper date ranking with fallback for null start_time
- âœ… **Frontend Simplification**: Remove client-side sorting and slicing
- âœ… **Filter Parameters**: Use callResult instead of status
- âœ… **Search Implementation**: Haystack approach for comprehensive search

### âœ… RESOLVED: Critical Call Sync Issues Fix

**Objective**: âœ… Fix critical issues in call synchronization system including phone number extraction, analysis timing, and data consistency.

**Key Requirements Completed**:
1. **Phone Number Extraction**: âœ… Fixed processConversation to always fetch details first
2. **Analysis Trigger Timing**: âœ… Fixed timing bug where call_result is checked before being computed
3. **Status Mapping**: âœ… Simplified frontend status mapping to use backend call_result

### âœ… RESOLVED: Comprehensive Sequence Revamp

**Objective**: âœ… Implement a robust, decoupled sequence management system with a full-featured UI.

**Key Requirements Completed**:
1. **Decoupled Architecture**: âœ… Sequence manager initiates calls and immediately schedules next attempt
2. **Duration-Based Cleanup**: âœ… Call-sync service triggers cleanup when duration > 7 seconds
3. **Full Sequence CRUD**: âœ… Users can create, view, edit, and delete sequences through UI
4. **Add Numbers to Sequences**: âœ… Users can select contacts/phone numbers and add them to sequences
5. **UI for Sequence Visibility**: âœ… Display number of contacts at each step/status within sequences
6. **"Do Not Call" Flag**: âœ… Implemented do_not_call boolean flag on contacts and phone_numbers tables


## High-level Task Breakdown

### âœ… COMPLETED: Phases 1-23 - Full System Implementation

**Phases 1-11**: âœ… ElevenLabs integration, call logging, Gemini analysis, dashboard with analytics
**Phase 12**: âœ… Database schema update - contacts and phone_numbers tables

### Current Status / Progress Tracking

- 2025-08-11: Executor removed duplicate `getCallByConversationId` definition from `services/supabase-db.js`. Verified no duplicate for sequence stats: code now intentionally has `getSequenceStatisticsByPhoneNumber(phoneNumber)` and `getSequenceStatisticsForSequence(sequenceId = null)` serving different scopes.

- 2025-08-11: Executor replaced `handleSequenceCallCompletion` in `index.js` to derive success from ElevenLabs canonical status and duration using `computeOutcomeFrom`. Now:
  - Fetches `getConversationDetailsEnhanced` for authoritative `status_raw`, `duration`, and phone number
  - Maps webhook `completed` to `done`; ignores non-final statuses (initiated/in-progress/processing)
  - Computes `call_result` and updates/creates call accordingly (no reliance on legacy `completed`)
  - Updates sequence entry with `successful = (call_result === 'answered')` and preserves raw status/duration

- 2025-08-11: Executor fixed initialization for new sequence entries in `services/supabase-db.js#addPhoneNumberToSequence`:
  - Set `current_attempt: 0` and `next_call_time` at insert time
  - If sequence has business hours configured, compute first `next_call_time` using `BusinessHoursService.calculateNextBusinessHoursTime(now, bh)` when outside BH; otherwise set to `now`
  - Impact: Newly added entries are immediately discoverable by `getReadySequenceEntries`, unblocking the dialer

- 2025-08-11: Executor fixed after-hours scheduling bug in `services/business-hours.js#addHoursRespectingBusinessHours`:
  - When local `currentTime > endTime`, advance to next day before setting to start time
  - Preserve weekend-skip logic after rolling forward
  - Impact: Prevents `next_call_time` being set in the past, avoiding immediate re-queue loops

- 2025-08-11: Executor prevented creation of bogus `'unknown'` phone number records:
  - In `services/supabase-db.js#createCall`, skip creating/upserting a `phone_numbers` row when phone is missing or `'unknown'`; allow `phone_number_id` to remain null
  - In `services/call-sync.js`, avoid overwriting an existing real `phone_number` with `'unknown'`; when creating minimal rows, set phone to null instead of `'unknown'`
  - Impact: No more `'unknown'` entries in `phone_numbers`, improving UX and stats integrity

- 2025-08-11: Executor resolved `SequenceManager` method collision breaking scheduling:
  - Renamed methods to `calculateNextCallTimeSimple(retryDelayHours, businessHours)` and `calculateNextCallTimeAdvanced(callData, analysisData)`
  - Updated `processReadySequenceEntries` to call the simple variant
  - Impact: Prevents Promises or wrong args being used for `next_call_time`; scheduling now correct

- 2025-08-11: Executor removed duplicate frontend functions in `public/index.html`:
  - Deleted earlier placeholder `editSequence`/`deleteSequence` definitions
  - Kept later fully implemented async versions only
  - Impact: Avoids confusion from last-definition-wins, simplifies maintenance
  
- 2025-08-11: Executor fixed Gemini analysis flow in `services/call-sync.js#processDetailedConversation`:
  - Switched to `geminiService.analyzeTranscript` (correct method)
  - Constructed plaintext transcript by joining speaker/text lines
  - Gated on `this.geminiService.initialized` to avoid futile calls
  - Passed only `result.analysis` object to `storeAnalysisResults`
  - Improved skip log to include service initialization state

- 2025-08-11: Executor consolidated duplicate CSS classes in `public/index.html`:
  - Removed later duplicate definitions of `.status-active`, `.status-inactive`, `.status-do-not-call` under the contact/sequence status section
  - Kept earlier CRM status indicator styles as the single source of truth
  - Impact: Avoids conflicting styles and CSS bloat; consistent status badge appearance across the app

- 2025-08-11: Executor consolidated duplicate/overlapping JS in `public/index.html`:
  - Removed alternative sequence details rendering in `callDetailsModal` and the `viewSequenceDetails` wrapper; kept dedicated `sequenceDetailsModal` flow with `loadSequenceDetails(sequenceId)`
  - Unified pagination to single `updatePagination(totalPages, totalCount)`; updated `loadCalls` and `performSearch` to use it
  - Merged `showCallsModal` and `showCallsModalWithPhoneId` into one function with optional `phoneNumberId`; updated callers
  - Removed unused `setActiveTab()`
  - Impact: Reduced duplication, clearer modal responsibilities, consistent pagination behavior

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- None. Webhook function is a drop-in replacement; no API surface changes required. Recommend:
  - Trigger `/webhook/elevenlabs-call-ended` with a real `conversation_id` to verify sequence update.
  - Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` and model are set so analysis path can run; otherwise it will skip with clear logs.

### Lessons

- Treat ElevenLabs finality strictly via `status_raw` and duration; never rely on `completed` from webhook. Compute success centrally with `computeOutcomeFrom`.

#### Phase 25 Detailed Plan (Actions, Files, Tests)

- Task 25.1: Fix Syntax Error in `services/call-sync.js`
  - Actions:
    - Open `services/call-sync.js`; remove stray character after `initialize()` method.
    - Run server start to verify module loads.
  - Files:
    - `services/call-sync.js`
  - Tests:
    - `node index.js` boots without syntax errors.
  - Success Criteria:
    - Server starts; no syntax/runtime error from call-sync on require.

- Task 25.2: Correct Business-Hours Service
  - Actions:
    - Replace imports with `const { utcToZonedTime, zonedTimeToUtc } = require('date-fns-tz');` in `services/business-hours.js`.
    - Standardize all timezone conversions to use `utcToZonedTime`/`zonedTimeToUtc`.
    - Rewrite `addHoursRespectingBusinessHours` to add seconds (handle fractional hours precisely).
    - Ensure `isWithinBusinessHours` and `calculateNextBusinessHoursTime` consistently use the same primitives; normalize to next valid window if outside.
    - Implement weekend skipping with `[0,6].includes(day)` checks where needed.
  - Files:
    - `services/business-hours.js`
    - Optional: `tmp_bh_test.js`, `tmp_check_tz.js` for quick checks
  - Tests (include DST boundary and weekend):
    - Outside hours â†’ moves to next start within same day.
    - Near end-of-day with multi-hour add â†’ rolls to next BH day start.
    - Friday after hours with exclude_weekends â†’ lands on Monday start.
    - Fractional add (e.g., 1.5 hours) preserves minutes/seconds.
    - Cross-timezone sanity (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `UTC`).
  - Success Criteria:
    - No ReferenceErrors; outputs are timezone-correct and deterministic.

- Task 25.3: Fix ElevenLabs Dialing Signature
  - Actions:
    - In `services/sequence-manager.js`, update `processReadySequenceEntries` to call:
      `makeOutboundCall(agentId, agentPhoneNumberId, toNumber, options)` using env `ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID` and `ELEVENLABS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`.
    - Add guard: if envs missing, log error and skip dialing with clear reason.
  - Files:
    - `services/sequence-manager.js`
    - `.env` or deployment config (ensure values present)
  - Tests:
    - Dry-run with mock/stub to verify parameters passed correctly.
    - Happy path: call initiation path reached when envs present.
    - Failure path: descriptive log and no crash when envs missing.
  - Success Criteria:
    - Sequence dialing path calls ElevenLabs with correct signature.

- Task 25.4: Resolve SupabaseDBService Method Collision
  - Actions:
    - In `services/supabase-db.js`, rename:
      - `getSequenceStatistics` (per-phone) â†’ `getSequenceStatisticsByPhoneNumber(phoneNumber)`
      - `getSequenceStatistics(sequenceId = null)` (sequence-level) â†’ `getSequenceStatisticsForSequence(sequenceId = null)`
    - Update all call sites (e.g., `services/sequence-manager.js`) to use the per-phone method for next-call calculation.
  - Files:
    - `services/supabase-db.js`
    - `services/sequence-manager.js` (and any others referencing old name)
  - Tests:
    - Verify per-phone stats return expected structure used by next-call logic.
    - Run a sequence step where next-call time depends on stats; confirm no exceptions and correct scheduling.
  - Success Criteria:
    - No method overrides; next-call computation uses correct stats.

- Task 25.5: Align Batch Add-to-Sequence Payload
  - Actions:
    - Update DB service method to accept `phoneNumberIds: number[]`.
    - Implement iteration and call `addPhoneNumberToSequence(sequenceId, id)` per id; ensure idempotent insert/upsert.
    - Update `index.js` POST `/api/sequences/:id/entries` to pass `{ phoneNumberIds }` through to DB service.
    - Ensure frontend request body sends `{ phoneNumberIds }` (update JS in `public/index.html` if needed).
  - Files:
    - `services/supabase-db.js`
    - `index.js`
    - `public/index.html` (JS that triggers batch add)
  - Tests:
    - API call with `[1,2,3]` succeeds; DB shows 3 entries.
    - Duplicate ids do not create duplicates (idempotency confirmed).
    - Error handling: invalid ids â†’ partial failure handling/logging.
  - Success Criteria:
    - Batch add works end-to-end with `{ phoneNumberIds }` payload.

- Task 25.6: Optimize `/api/calls`
  - Actions:
    - In `services/supabase-db.js#getCallsWithAdvancedFilters`, apply filters directly in SQL using `calls_with_analysis` columns (`meeting_booked`, `person_interested`, `person_very_upset`).
    - Remove per-row `getBookingAnalysisByCallId` enrichment in `index.js` `/api/calls` handler.
    - Ensure pagination and ordering happen in SQL only; do not re-filter in JS.
  - Files:
    - `services/supabase-db.js`
    - `index.js`
  - Tests:
    - Pagination stable with filters applied.
    - Response rows already contain analysis booleans; no extra DB hits per row.
    - Compare latency before/after (expect reduction) on pages of 50â€“100 rows.
  - Success Criteria:
    - No N+1 behavior; filters applied in SQL; correct ordering and pagination.

- Task 25.7: Tests & Validation
  - Actions:
    - Create/extend quick scripts: `tmp_bh_test.js`, `tmp_seq_update_test.js`, `test-db.js` for non-interactive validation.
    - Manual smoke tests for dialing path with envs set and unset.
    - Verify `/api/calls` with combinations of analysis filters and pagination.
  - Acceptance Checklist:
    - Server boot without syntax errors.
    - Business-hours math correct across timezones and weekends.
    - Sequence dialing initiates correctly.
    - Batch add creates correct entries without duplicates.
    - `/api/calls` has no redundant per-row queries.
