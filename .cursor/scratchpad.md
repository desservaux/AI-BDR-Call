2. **Monitor Real-Time Performance**: Check the latency monitor dashboard during calls
3. **Analyze HumeAI Processing**: The issue may be in how HumeAI processes audio and generates responses
4. **Check Network Latency**: Verify if there are network delays between Twilio and HumeAI
5. **Review HumeAI Configuration**: The custom configuration may need optimization for faster response times

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Test ultra-low latency call
node test-ultra-low-latency-call.js

# Or test directly via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/make-ultra-low-latency-call \

## Lessons

- When debugging Twilio webhook integration issues, check the following:
    1. **Webhook URL Configuration**: Ensure the webhook URL is correctly formatted and accessible.
    2. **Authentication**: Verify API keys and authentication credentials are properly configured.
    3. **Audio Format Compatibility**: Ensure audio formats are compatible between Twilio and HumeAI.
    4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms for webhook failures.
- Use Twilio Debugger Logs for detailed error messages, which are essential for identifying root causes like authentication failures or webhook configuration issues.
- HumeAI requires continuous audio input to maintain connections - implement proper silence handling and audio streaming.

### üîç **LESSONS FROM DIRECT INTEGRATION**

- **Webhook Configuration is Critical**: Proper webhook URL formatting and authentication are essential for successful Twilio-HumeAI integration.

- **Custom Configuration Testing**: Always test HumeAI custom configurations directly via WebSocket before integrating with webhooks to isolate configuration vs integration issues.

- **Audio Format Compatibility**: Ensure audio formats are compatible between Twilio and HumeAI to prevent audio quality issues.

- **Error Handling is Essential**: Implement robust error handling and retry logic for webhook failures to maintain system reliability.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.

### üîä **HUMEAI AUDIO STREAMING LESSONS**

- **Continuous Audio is Critical**: HumeAI requires continuous audio input to maintain the connection. If no audio is sent for even a short period, HumeAI interprets this as a disconnected stream and reports "user ended" status.

- **Silence Frames Are Essential**: When there's no actual audio to send (e.g., during quiet periods or when waiting for the caller to speak), you MUST send silence frames (zeros) to keep the connection alive. Not sending anything is interpreted as a disconnection.

- **Session Settings Required for PCM**: When using raw PCM audio (linear16), you must send a session_settings message immediately after connecting to specify the audio format, sample rate, and number of channels. Without this, HumeAI may misinterpret the audio data.

- **Audio Queue Management**: Implement a proper queue for audio frames to ensure they're sent in order and that silence frames are only sent when there's no real audio to process. This prevents audio corruption and maintains stream continuity.

### üîß **LIVEKIT INTEGRATION LESSONS (FOR REFERENCE)**

*Note: LiveKit integration has been paused but these lessons remain valuable for future reference.*

- **Import Errors Can Cause Silent Agent Failures**: The `ImportError: cannot import name 'rtc' from 'livekit.agents'` caused agents to crash immediately after registration, leading to the false impression that dispatch was working but agents were disappearing.

- **Agent Registration ‚â† Agent Dispatch**: An agent can successfully register with LiveKit Cloud but still never receive dispatch events. Always verify both registration AND entrypoint execution.

- **Direct Configuration Testing is Critical**: Testing HumeAI configuration directly (via WebSocket) confirmed the configuration was working perfectly, isolating the issue to the dispatch mechanism rather than the configuration.

- **LiveKit Dispatch Rules May Not Apply to Outbound Calls**: The dispatch system may be designed primarily for inbound calls, requiring different approaches for outbound call agent joining.

- **Comprehensive Logging is Essential**: Adding detailed logging with `"üéâ ENTRYPOINT CALLED!"` messages made it immediately clear whether agents were being dispatched, distinguishing between registration and dispatch issues.

- **Trunk Association is Critical**: LiveKit dispatch rules MUST have the trunk ID in their `trunk_ids` array for calls coming through that trunk to be dispatched. An empty `trunk_ids: []` means no calls will be dispatched.

- **Rule Conflicts Prevent Updates**: LiveKit prevents multiple dispatch rules from using the same trunk+number+PIN combination. If you get a "Conflicting SIP Dispatch Rules" error, you need to delete one of the conflicting rules first.

- **Don't Overcomplicate**: Sometimes the issue is simpler than expected. In this case, it wasn't a complex dispatch mechanism problem, just a missing trunk ID association in the dispatch rule configuration.
