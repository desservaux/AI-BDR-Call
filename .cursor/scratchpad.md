**NEXT OBJECTIVE**: ðŸŽ¯ Phase 24 - Business Hours Feature for Sequences
Add business hours functionality to sequences, allowing users to define timezone, time range, and exclude weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) from call scheduling.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### âœ… RESOLVED: ElevenLabs Integration and Dashboard
- âœ… ElevenLabs API integration and call management
- âœ… Comprehensive call logging for all calls (including external)
- âœ… Gemini transcript analysis with boolean storage
- âœ… Advanced dashboard with filtering, pagination, and analytics
- âœ… Call detail views with transcript enhancement

### âœ… RESOLVED: ElevenLabs Sync Data Mapping Issues
- âœ… Fixed status mapping logic with duration-based computation
- âœ… Standardized start_time extraction from ElevenLabs metadata
- âœ… Implemented call filtering for non-final calls
- âœ… Removed dependency on ElevenLabs' call_successful field

### âœ… RESOLVED: ElevenLabs Normalization and Outcome Computation

**Objective**: âœ… Implement comprehensive normalization of ElevenLabs API data and outcome computation based on call_result field only.

**Key Requirements Completed**:
1. **Outcome Computation Function**: âœ… Added `computeOutcomeFrom(status_raw, durationSecs)` function
   - âœ… If status_raw in ['initiated','in-progress','processing'] â†’ return null (not final)
   - âœ… If status_raw === 'done': durationSecs > 5 â†’ 'answered', else â†’ 'unanswered'
   - âœ… If status_raw === 'failed': durationSecs > 5 â†’ 'answered' (override), else â†’ 'failed'

2. **ElevenLabs Normalization**: âœ… Updated `getConversationDetailsEnhanced()`:
   - âœ… Extract from documented fields: start_time, duration, status_raw, message_count, transcript
   - âœ… Extract call_summary_title, transcript_summary
   - âœ… Extract to_number from best available documented location
   - âœ… Use proper fallbacks for transcript data

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- âœ… **Outcome Computation**: Implemented pure function based on status_raw and duration only
- âœ… **Data Extraction**: Use documented ElevenLabs API fields consistently
- âœ… **Transcript Handling**: Proper fallback strategies for transcript data
- âœ… **Phone Number Extraction**: Found best documented location for to_number

### âœ… RESOLVED: Sync Flow for Final Calls Only

**Objective**: âœ… Implement sync flow that only persists final calls with call_result, removing dependency on status and answered fields.

**Key Requirements Completed**:
1. **CallSyncService.processConversation()**: âœ… Updated
   - âœ… If status_raw in ['initiated','in-progress','processing'] â†’ skip early; do not persist anything
   - âœ… For status_raw in ['done','failed']: create minimal row or process existing call
   - âœ… Immediately call processDetailedConversation() for all final calls

2. **CallSyncService.processDetailedConversation()**: âœ… Updated
   - âœ… Fetch enhanced details; build consolidatedData with all required fields
   - âœ… Compute call_result = computeOutcomeFrom(status_raw, duration)
   - âœ… Update call with only call_result (not status or answered)
   - âœ… Replace transcriptions: delete by call_id; insert mapped transcript
   - âœ… Run analysis with new criteria: duration >= 10, message_count >= 2, call_result !== 'failed'

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- âœ… **Final Call Filtering**: Only process calls with status 'done' or 'failed'
- âœ… **Minimal Row Creation**: Create minimal rows for new final calls
- âœ… **Outcome Computation**: Use only call_result field, remove answered dependency
- âœ… **Analysis Criteria**: Updated analysis conditions to use new criteria

### âœ… RESOLVED: API and Sorting Definitive Fix

**Objective**: âœ… Implement definitive fix for result ranking by date with proper backend ordering and frontend rendering.

**Key Requirements**:
1. **Backend Sorting**: 
   - Chain orders: `.order('start_time', { ascending: false }).order('created_at', { ascending: false })`
   - Node.js sort fallback: `calls.sort((a,b) => new Date(b.start_time || b.created_at) - new Date(a.start_time || a.created_at))`

2. **Frontend Rendering**:
   - Don't sort; render in order received from backend
   - Ensure pagination matches backend
   - Use callResult parameter instead of status for filtering
   - Only show badges for answered/unanswered/failed
   - Fix duration formatting: minutes and seconds
   - Build haystack search: `[phone_number, enhanced_status, meeting_booked, person_interested, person_very_upset].join(' ')`

**Critical Issues to Address**:
- âœ… **Backend Ordering**: Proper date ranking with fallback for null start_time
- âœ… **Frontend Simplification**: Remove client-side sorting and slicing
- âœ… **Filter Parameters**: Use callResult instead of status
- âœ… **Search Implementation**: Haystack approach for comprehensive search

### âœ… RESOLVED: Critical Call Sync Issues Fix

**Objective**: âœ… Fix critical issues in call synchronization system including phone number extraction, analysis timing, and data consistency.

**Key Requirements Completed**:
1. **Phone Number Extraction**: âœ… Fixed processConversation to always fetch details first
2. **Analysis Trigger Timing**: âœ… Fixed timing bug where call_result is checked before being computed
3. **Status Mapping**: âœ… Simplified frontend status mapping to use backend call_result

### âœ… RESOLVED: Comprehensive Sequence Revamp

**Objective**: âœ… Implement a robust, decoupled sequence management system with a full-featured UI.

**Key Requirements Completed**:
1. **Decoupled Architecture**: âœ… Sequence manager initiates calls and immediately schedules next attempt
2. **Duration-Based Cleanup**: âœ… Call-sync service triggers cleanup when duration > 7 seconds
3. **Full Sequence CRUD**: âœ… Users can create, view, edit, and delete sequences through UI
4. **Add Numbers to Sequences**: âœ… Users can select contacts/phone numbers and add them to sequences
5. **UI for Sequence Visibility**: âœ… Display number of contacts at each step/status within sequences
6. **"Do Not Call" Flag**: âœ… Implemented do_not_call boolean flag on contacts and phone_numbers tables

### ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT CHALLENGE: Business Hours Feature for Sequences

**Objective**: Add business hours functionality to sequences, allowing users to define timezone, time range, and exclude weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) from call scheduling.

**Key Requirements**:
1. **Database Schema Updates**: 
   - Add business_hours fields to sequences table

- Proceeding with Task 25.4 â€” unify call persistence (in progress)

### Task 25.4 Progress
- Ensured `call-sync.js` uses `CallService` for transcriptions via `insertTranscriptions` (fixed method name mismatch)
- Both `call-logger.js` and `call-sync.js` depend on `CallService` for DB writes
- Next: audit remaining direct DB calls and migrate to `CallService` methods where appropriate

### Task 25.5 Progress
- Added `services/utils/statusMap.js` and replaced inline `mapCallStatus` in `index.js`
- Added `services/utils/parseBool.js` and applied to contacts/phone-numbers endpoints
- Frontend already centralizes formatting in `public/js/utils.js`; no duplicate cleanup needed there

### Task 25.7 (Dropped)
- Not needed anymore per latest decision; no further work planned here

### Task 25.3 Implementation Notes
- Added `services/sequences/SequenceService.js` with `updateAfterCall(entryId, callResult)`

- Max attempts logic applied centrally: YES
**ðŸ“‹ Task 24.4 Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Users can configure business hours through intuitive UI
- âœ… Timezone selector with common timezones works correctly
- âœ… Time range pickers for start and end times function properly
- âœ… Weekend exclusion checkbox works as expected
- âœ… Business hours display in sequence details is clear
- âœ… Validation and error handling provides clear feedback


Phase 25: Major Refactor for Simplicity & Maintainability

Objective: Reduce code complexity and file size by breaking monolithic files into smaller, focused modules, consolidating duplicate logic, and centralizing shared concerns â€” without removing any current features.

Task 25.1: Refactor supabase-db.js into smaller repositories (HIGH PRIORITY)

Issue:
s./services/supabase-db.js is ~1500 lines and mixes:

Calls CRUD
Transcriptions
Events
Booking Analysis
Contacts
Phone Numbers
Sequences
CSV parsing and uploads
Sequence state transitions
Plan:
Split into targeted classes in /services/db/:


/services/db/
  CallsRepo.js
  TranscriptionsRepo.js
  BookingAnalysisRepo.js
  ContactsRepo.js
  PhoneNumbersRepo.js
  SequencesRepo.js
  SequenceEntriesRepo.js
  FileUploadService.js
index.js in /db will initialize and export these as a single db object.
API and service layers will import only what they need.
All DB queries moved into these repos. No SQL in unrelated files.
Common Supabase client connection in dbClient.js.
Benefit: Scoped file sizes <200 lines each, faster onboarding, easier to test each repo.

Task 25.2: Split giant frontend script in public/index.html into modules (HIGH PRIORITY)

Issue:
The entire frontend app (tab control, modals, API calls, analytics chart rendering) lives in a single giant inline <script>.

Plan: Move into /public/js/:


/public/js/
  main.js          // bootstraps app, attaches event listeners
  api.js           // fetch helpers
  ui.js            // tab switching, modals
  calls.js         // calls tab logic
  contacts.js      // contacts tab logic
  sequences.js     // sequences tab logic
  phoneNumbers.js  // phone numbers tab logic
  analytics.js     // chart setup
  utils.js         // pagination, formatting, status mapping
Set <script type="module"> in index.html for tree-shakable imports.
Each tab module will bind to DOM on activation.
 Progress:
 - Added `public/js/{main,api,utils,analytics,calls,contacts,sequences,phoneNumbers,callDetails}.js`
 - Wired `<script type="module" src="/public/js/main.js">` and kept legacy inline script for parity
 - Migrated: status checks, tab/nav init, analytics load/refresh, calls list/pagination/search/filters, call details modal, contacts list/filters, sequences and phone numbers lists/filters
 - Next: move remaining modals (sequence add/edit, uploads), Chart.js rendering, and remove replaced inline blocks

 Benefit:
Frontend becomes navigable, smaller per file; new contributors can focus on one tab at a time.

Task 25.3: Unify sequence handling logic (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

Issue:

index.js, sequence-manager.js, and supabase-db.js all have overlapping logic for updating sequence entries after calls.
This duplication risks inconsistencies.
Plan:

Create /services/sequences/SequenceService.js
Have a single method: updateAfterCall(sequenceEntryId, callResult) that handles:
Status transitions
Business hours scheduling
Max attempts logic
API just calls the SequenceService.
Benefit: One source of truth, less surface for bugs.

Task 25.4: Merge call-sync.js and call-logger.js shared logic (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

Issue:

Both fetch/update calls and write to DB in similar ways.
DB persistence logic is duplicated.
Plan:

Create /services/calls/CallService.js
Both CallSync and CallLogger depend on it for persistence (create, update, insert transcripts).
Keep their connection/polling logic separate.
Benefit:
Removes duplication, ensures all call persistence follows the same rules.

Task 25.5: Consolidate duplicate utilities (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

Issue:
Helpers like boolean parsing from query params, status mapping, duration formatting are repeated in several files.

Plan:

Create /utils/ with reusable:

parseBool.js
statusMap.js
formatDate.js
pagination.js
Refactor API and frontend to import these.
Benefit: Less code, identical behavior everywhere.

Task 25.6: Simplify API endpoints (LOW-Hanging High Return)

Issue:

/api/calls does N+1 queries for analysis even though calls_with_analysis view exists.
Plan:

Return enriched calls from DB view directly.
Drop extra getBookingAnalysisByCallId calls in per-call mapping.
This will also improve performance.
Benefit: Fewer queries, faster API, less backend mapping code.

Task 25.7: Migrations Refactor (LOW PRIORITY)

Issue:

database-migration.js embeds large SQL strings.
Harder to diff or roll back.
Plan:

Switch to SQL files in /migrations/ (e.g., 001_init.sql, 002_business_hours.sql).
Use a Node runner to apply in order.
Benefit: Git-friendly schema changes, easier rollback.

Task 25.8: Remove / Collapse Dead Code (LOW PRIORITY follow-up after split)

After splitting modules, weâ€™ll have a clearer view of:

Which old helper functions are no longer used
Which leftovers from earlier implementations can be safely deleted
ðŸ’¡ Refactor Prioritization:

High impact, high urgency:
Task 25.1 (supabase-db.js split)
Task 25.2 (frontend modularization)
Medium:
Task 25.3 (sequence update unification)
Task 25.4 (call persistence unification)
Low but valuable:
Task 25.5 (utils consolidation)
Task 25.6 (API simplification)
Task 25.7 (migration extract)

- âœ… **Phone Number Extraction**: Always fetch detailed API data for final calls to get accurate phone numbers; list responses may have null values.
- âœ… **Analysis Timing**: Compute call_result before building consolidatedData to avoid timing bugs in analysis triggers.
- âœ… **Status Mapping**: Use single source of truth (backend call_result) instead of duplicating duration-based logic in frontend.
- âœ… **Sequence Architecture**: Decoupled "fire and forget" approach with immediate next scheduling works well for scalability.
- âœ… **Do Not Call Logic**: Implement at both contact and phone number levels for granular control.
