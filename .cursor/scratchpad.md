## Key Challenges and Analysis

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: ElevenLabs Integration and Dashboard
- ‚úÖ ElevenLabs API integration and call management
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive call logging for all calls (including external)
- ‚úÖ Gemini transcript analysis with boolean storage
- ‚úÖ Advanced dashboard with filtering, pagination, and analytics
- ‚úÖ Call detail views with transcript enhancement

### üéØ CURRENT CHALLENGE: ElevenLabs Sync Data Mapping Issues

**Objective**: Fix critical data synchronization problems between ElevenLabs API and Supabase database to ensure accurate call history display matching ElevenLabs UI.

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. **Incorrect Status Mapping**: Current system maps ElevenLabs statuses incorrectly and processes incomplete calls
2. **Date Display Mismatch**: Multiple calls showing on same date in UI vs ElevenLabs, inconsistent date extraction
3. **Missing Evaluation Results**: Status field not storing proper call outcomes ("answered", "no answer", "failed")
4. **Incomplete Call Filtering**: Processing in-progress/initiated calls that should be skipped

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Contacts, Sequences, and Uploads

**Previous Objective**: Update schema for contacts and phone numbers, implement views for calls per person/number, sequence management, and contact upload feature.

**Key Requirements**:
1. **Database Schema Update**: Add contacts and phone_numbers tables, update calls table with links and new fields like call_result, answered.
2. **Contacts Management**: Handle people with multiple phones, names, email, company, position.
3. **Call Views**: Lists of calls per contact and per phone number.
4. **Sequences**: Put numbers into sequences for retries if unanswered, track attempts, next call time.
5. **Uploads**: Upload CSV lists of contacts, parse and insert into DB, add to sequences.
6. **Future Notes**: Ability to add notes after calls (e.g., callback time).
7. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all new views are mobile-friendly.
8. **Performance**: Efficient querying for large datasets, migration without data loss.

**Challenges**:
- Safe schema migration on existing data, handling cases where numbers don't have associated contacts initially.
- Handling unknown contacts/numbers gracefully.
- Implementing sequence logic without overcomplicating, including batch calling with concurrency limits.
- Parsing and validating uploaded CSV data.
- Ensuring data consistency (e.g., propagating 'do_not_call' status).

- [x] **Task 18.3**: Implement Streamlined Sync Flow and Outcome Computation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Remove dependency on ElevenLabs' call_successful
  - **Requirements**:
    - Persist outcome fields we control: call_result ('answered' | 'unanswered' | 'failed') and answered (boolean)
    - Use ElevenLabs only for raw metadata (status, start_time, duration, numbers, transcript)
    - Ensure UI shows correct status, time, and number aligned with ElevenLabs UI
  - **Success Criteria**: System uses our own outcome computation, not ElevenLabs' call_successful
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Updated ElevenLabs service to remove call_successful dependency

### üéØ IN PROGRESS: Phase 18 - ElevenLabs Sync Data Mapping Fixes

**Objective**: Fix critical data synchronization issues between ElevenLabs API and Supabase database to ensure call history matches ElevenLabs UI exactly.

**Current Tasks**:
- [x] **Task 18.1**: Fix Status Mapping Logic and Call Filtering (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - Fixed mapElevenLabsStatus() function to implement new logic
  - Added call filtering to skip incomplete calls (in-progress, initiated, processing)
  - Implemented duration-based mapping: >5s = "answered", ‚â§5s = "no answer"
  - Added override logic for "failed" calls with duration > 5s ‚Üí "answered"
  - Success Criteria: Only completed calls stored with correct status values
  - **Final Result**: 16 answered, 2 failed, 1 no_answer calls correctly classified

- [x] **Task 18.2**: Fix Date Extraction and Display Consistency (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - Standardize start_time extraction from ElevenLabs API
  - Ensure UI displays actual call attempt time, not sync time
  - Success Criteria: UI dates match ElevenLabs UI dates exactly

- [x] **Task 18.3**: Investigate and Resolve Duplicate Call Display (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - Investigate multiple 05/08 calls in UI vs single ElevenLabs call
  - Verify database uniqueness constraints working properly
  - Success Criteria: Call count matches between systems

**CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**:
- ‚ùå **Status Mapping Logic**: Current mapElevenLabsStatus() processes incomplete calls and uses wrong logic
- ‚ùå **Date Extraction**: Multiple date sources causing UI/ElevenLabs date mismatch 
- ‚ùå **Call Filtering**: Processing in-progress/initiated calls that should be skipped
- ‚ùå **Duplicate Display**: Multiple calls showing on same date in UI vs single call in ElevenLabs

**ROOT CAUSES ANALYZED**:
- **Status Logic**: Maps 'done' to 'completed' instead of duration-based "answered"/"no answer"
- **Date Sources**: Complex fallback logic using sync time instead of actual call time
- **Incomplete Filtering**: No logic to skip calls that aren't ready for database storage
- **Display Logic**: UI shows start_time OR created_at, causing date inconsistencies
